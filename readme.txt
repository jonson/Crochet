Welcome to Crochet

Crochet is a light weight web framework oriented to rapid prototyping of
REST API. If you are looking for a Rails like framework written in Scala,
please take a look at Lift (http://liftweb.net/).

Crochet targets to help quickly prototype APIs relying on the flexibility
of the Scala language. The initial ideas for Crochet were inspired after
reading Gabriele Renzi post on create a picoframework with Scala (see
http://www.riffraff.info/2009/4/11/step-a-scala-web-picoframework) and
the need for quickly prototyping APIs for pilot projects.
